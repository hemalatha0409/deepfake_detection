**Introduction**

Deepfakes are synthetic media in which a person in an existing image or video is replaced with someone else's likeness using AI techniques. This project aims to detect such manipulations by leveraging CNNs for feature extraction and RNNs for temporal analysis.

**Features**

Hybrid Model: Combines CNN for spatial analysis and RNN for temporal patterns.

Dataset Integration: Supports popular deepfake datasets.

Evaluation Metrics: Provides accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for model assessment.

**Installation**

**Clone the repository:**

git clone < repository-url >

cd < repository-name >

**Install the required dependencies:**

pip install -r requirements.txt

**Usage**

**Open the Jupyter Notebook:**

jupyter notebook

Load the notebook file deepfake-detection-using-cnn-rnn.ipynb.

Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the dataset, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

**Results**

The model achieves high accuracy in detecting deepfakes. Detailed evaluation metrics and visualizations are available in the notebook.

**Contributing**

Contributions are welcome! Please fork the repository, create a feature branch, and submit a pull request.
